[Customer details including name, account number, occupation, KYC rating]

III. DESCRIPTION OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
The following structured deposits were identified:
- [TRANSACTION_LIST]
- Pattern: Multiple deposits just below INR 10,00,000 threshold
- Frequency: [FREQUENCY] deposits over [DAYS] days
- Total: INR [TOTAL] across [COUNT] transactions

IV. EXPLANATION OF SUSPICION
The deposit pattern is consistent with structuring/smurfing activity as defined under PMLA guidelines. The deliberate fragmentation of deposits below the INR 10,00,000 threshold suggests intentional avoidance of reporting requirements under Section 12 of PMLA, 2002. This is further supported by:
- Volume exceeding expected monthly activity by [RATIO]x
- Round-number deposits suggesting premeditated structuring
- Timing pattern consistent with deliberate threshold avoidance

V. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Based on the identified pattern, this activity warrants immediate filing of an STR with FIU-IND under Section 12 of PMLA, 2002. Enhanced due diligence and ongoing monitoring are recommended for this account. The 7-day filing deadline under RBI guidelines must be adhered to.
